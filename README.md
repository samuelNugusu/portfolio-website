# React Portfolio Merge â€” Updated

- Attractive but not too colorful (subtle gradients, glass, soft shadows).
- New pages: **Services**, **Blog**.

npm install
npm run dev
```

## Customize
- Update name, links, colors in components and pages.
- Move sections from your two portfolios into these React pages.
- Replace the map iframe and contact details with your own.
